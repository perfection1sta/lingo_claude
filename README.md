# Lingo Claude

This is an AI chatbot that uses Whatsapp & Anthropic's Claude3 as the LLM to power conversations. The prompt given is that of a helpful friendly teacher who you can ask any question.
This project was an idea I had since a while as I strongly believe the best way to learn a language is through real conversations with people. Thankfully LLMs have made it possible to do this without the human dependence.

Imagine you could pick up your phone & continue your conversation with someone about whatever YOU would like to talk about. Enter lingo_claude.

To use the app, install the requirements.txt file. Copy or create a pull request. Set up your API keys and save them as environment variables.

Ensure you run ngrok & flask on the same local port. Enter the ngrok URI into the Twilio Sandbox config in 'When a message comes in'. Hit save.

Run python3 duo_app.py

Boom
