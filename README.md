# lingo_claude

This is an AI chatbot project that uses Anthropic's Claude3 as the LLM to power conversations. The prompt given is that of a helpful friendly teacher who you can ask any question.
This project was an idea I had since a while as I strongly believe the best way to learn a language is through real conversations with people. Thankfully LLMs have made it possible to do this without the human part.

Imagine you could pick up your phone & continue your conversation with someone about whatever YOU would like to talk about. Enter lingo_claude.
